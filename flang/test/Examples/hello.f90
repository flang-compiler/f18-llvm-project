! Note: The Fortran runtime libraries have dependences on the C++ runtime and
! LLVM libraries.  To work around the former, this test explicitly links in
! libstdc++.a.  To work around the latter, the source of Common/enum-set.h was
! hacked to exclude references to llvm ADTs.
! Note: On linux, the Fortran runtime wants to include libm as well.
! Note: Add pic to the compilation as gcc will use shared libraries by
! default when they are available.
